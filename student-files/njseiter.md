Dear Hayley,

You are the most amazing instructor I have ever had. my entire college experience is all down hill from here. I'm actually not even sure I will ever meet another human being who is an awesome as you. I was in no way coerced into writing this and it is entirely of my own volition.

From,
Noah Seiter
